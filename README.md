# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project uses a CNN model in TensorFlow to recognize hand gestures from images. It supports real-time gesture recognition using a webcam.

## Structure
- `scripts/train.py`: Train the CNN model
- `scripts/predict.py`: Predict using saved model
- `scripts/real_time.py`: Use webcam for real-time detection

## Dataset
Sign Language MNIST: https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt`
